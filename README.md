# YTD-downloader
Hey guys!

I developed a software which lets you download YouTube videos very easily. It is very easy to use and it works only in Window 7/8/10. We the developers of NEOS will make it more efficient and easy. We promise you that we will launch the Linux and other versions too as soon as possible.
Here is the download link – 

Click on the above link and download it directly in your computer(Windows).
1)	Install the app in folder you want. And click on the exe file to start the application.
2)	After you click on it you must see this kind of screen.
3)	To download the YouTube video, you have to get the link of the video (YouTube>Desired Video>Share>Copy link/Copy link to the clipboard).
4)	Paste the copied link in the entry section named as ‘Video link’.
5)	Now, you may choose your desired option: -
      Best Quality – To download the best quality video. (Recommended for projects and commercial uses)
      Average Quality – It is the default one, to download the okay-okay video for your personal use.
      Data Saver – To save your data, in case you need it.
      Audio/Song – To download the mp3 version of the video. (Recommended for songs so that you can play them in music player)
6)	Then click on the ‘Download’ to download the video, soon after you may see the progress in the progress bar, as soon as the progress bar is completed you will see a pop up message informing you that video has been downloaded.
